This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, currently hosted on [porkypus-site.vercel.app](http://porkypus-site.vercel.app). This website was mostly inspired by [craftz.dog](https://www.craftz.dog), and uses much of the code structure and libraries that were used for it. The blender model used can be obtained on [baba.pig's sketchfab page](https://skfb.ly/oxZPu), and is licensed under a [CC attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).
